# Notebook Enhancement Task List

This document outlines recommended follow-up tasks to improve the quality, clarity, and completeness of the notebooks in this repository. The focus is on polishing explanations, strengthening solved examples, and ensuring every exercise is fully answered.

## Status Summary

**Last Updated:** October 2025

‚úÖ **Completed** - All core improvement tasks for the main notebooks have been implemented.  
‚è≥ **In Progress** - PDF guide alignment review (scheduled for next curriculum review cycle).  
üìù **Future** - Linting setup for exported Python scripts (when scripts are generated from notebooks).  
üìã **Ongoing** - Student feedback collection to inform future enhancements.

## Global Notebook Improvements
- ‚úÖ Standardize introductory cells with a brief overview of learning objectives, prerequisites, and estimated completion time.
- ‚úÖ Add a "How to Use This Notebook" section describing conventions (e.g., where to write answers, how to run tests).
- ‚úÖ Review all markdown explanations for grammar and clarity; expand terse descriptions with real-world context and intuitive explanations.
- ‚úÖ Insert summary cells at the end of each major section that recap key takeaways and provide quick-reference tables where appropriate.
- ‚úÖ Ensure every code solution cell includes inline comments that explain the reasoning, plus docstrings for any custom helper functions.
- ‚úÖ Where suitable, demonstrate expected outputs with formatted tables or plots to make results visually appealing.

## Notebook-Specific Tasks

### `1- basics_list_dict_questions.ipynb`
- ‚úÖ Audit each exercise for completeness; finish any partially solved or placeholder answers.
- ‚úÖ Enrich solved examples with additional real-world scenarios (e.g., inventory tracking, student grading) to illustrate practical applications of lists and dictionaries.
- ‚úÖ Add short conceptual checkpoints after each section to reinforce understanding.
- ‚úÖ Include a final consolidation challenge that integrates lists and dictionaries in a single task, followed by a detailed walkthrough solution.

### `2-nested_tuple_set_questions.ipynb`
- ‚úÖ Verify solutions for nested tuple manipulations and set operations; fill in missing responses.
- ‚úÖ Provide visual aids (such as Venn diagram descriptions) to clarify union/intersection/difference operations.
- ‚úÖ Introduce performance notes comparing tuples vs. lists and sets vs. other collections.
- ‚úÖ Append a "Common Pitfalls" section highlighting frequent mistakes (e.g., mutability misconceptions).

### `3-control_flow_questions.ipynb`
- ‚úÖ Complete any outstanding control-flow challenges, ensuring coverage of `if/else`, `for`, `while`, and comprehension patterns.
- ‚úÖ Enhance explanations with flowcharts or pseudo-code outlining decision-making logic.
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate debugging techniques, such as printing intermediate states or using assertions.

### `3-list_comprehension_questions-2.ipynb`
- ‚úÖ Normalize the notebook title and metadata for consistency (remove spaces or stray characters in the filename).
- ‚úÖ Add step-by-step comparisons between traditional loops and list comprehensions, emphasizing readability and performance.
- ‚úÖ Include advanced comprehension exercises (nested loops, conditional comprehensions) with thorough solutions.
- ‚úÖ Supplement with practice problems converting comprehension logic into generator expressions where appropriate.

### `Practice/list_lambda_map_filter_questions.ipynb`
- ‚úÖ Finish all incomplete exercises, providing both the final code and detailed reasoning.
- ‚úÖ Expand solved examples to showcase practical data transformations (e.g., preprocessing strings, numeric scaling) using `map`, `filter`, and `lambda`.
- ‚úÖ Add cautionary notes about readability trade-offs when overusing anonymous functions.
- ‚úÖ Include a challenge section that introduces `functools.reduce` and compares it with comprehension-based alternatives.

### `Practice/python_functions_questions.ipynb`
- ‚úÖ Ensure every function-based question has a complete solution with clear docstrings and parameter descriptions.
- ‚úÖ Introduce test cells that leverage `unittest` or simple assertion checks to validate function behavior.
- ‚úÖ Highlight best practices for default arguments, variable scope, and recursion with illustrative examples.
- ‚úÖ Add extension exercises encouraging the creation of small utility modules assembled from prior answers.

## Additional Follow-Up
- ‚è≥ Review the PDF guide for alignment with updated notebook content and annotate any discrepancies that need reconciliation. (To be done in future curriculum review)
- ‚úÖ Consider creating a `SOLUTIONS_OVERVIEW.md` that links to each notebook section and summarizes solved topics for quick navigation.
- üìù Set up a linting or formatting pass (e.g., `black`, `flake8`) for any exported `.py` scripts derived from the notebooks. (Note: No standalone Python scripts exist yet; this applies to future exports)
- üìã Gather student feedback to prioritize which notebooks require deeper explanations or more practice problems. (Ongoing process)
