# Solutions Overview

This guide links to each notebook and summarises the refreshed content so instructors can navigate the updated practice material quickly.

## Core Notebooks

### 1- basics_list_dict_questions.ipynb
- Reinforced numeric fundamentals, list manipulations, and dictionary lookups with inline commentary.
- Added conceptual checkpoints, summary tables, and a consolidation challenge covering list/dictionary integration.

### 2-nested_tuple_set_questions.ipynb
- Enhanced explanations for nested collections alongside ASCII-based set visualisations.
- Documented performance notes and common pitfalls when choosing between tuples, lists, and sets.

### 3-control_flow_questions.ipynb
- Introduced flowchart-style reasoning aids, debugging guidance, and recap tables for conditionals and loops.
- Solutions now feature explanatory comments for every branch and iteration.

### 3-list_comprehension_questions-2.ipynb
- Standardised filename and metadata, added loop vs. comprehension comparisons, and provided advanced nested exercises.
- Highlighted generator-expression alternatives for memory-conscious pipelines.

### Practice/list_lambda_map_filter_questions.ipynb
- Expanded every exercise with practical business narratives, cautionary notes on lambda readability, and a reduce challenge.
- Each code cell includes reasoning comments plus end-of-notebook summaries.

### Practice/python_functions_questions.ipynb
- Added usage guidance, best-practice reminders for defaults/scope/recursion, and automated unit tests.
- Extension exercises encourage packaging utilities into a reusable module.

## Additional Alignment Notes
- Cross-reference the "Python_Guide - Session 1,2 and 3.pdf" during the next curriculum review to ensure terminology matches the refreshed notebooks.
- Run project-wide formatters (e.g., `black` on exported `.py` files) before distributing materials to learners.
- Collect learner feedback after the next cohort completes these notebooks to prioritise further enhancements.
