# Python Course: Guided Improvement Material

This repository contains a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks, practice exercises, and reference material designed to reinforce Python fundamentals for data analysis. The content follows the roadmap captured in `IMPROVEMENT_TASKS.md` and the `SOLUTIONS_OVERVIEW.md` index to help learners track solved examples and future enhancements.

## Repository structure

- `1- basics_list_dict_questions.ipynb` – list and dictionary fundamentals with guided practice, reflection checkpoints, and consolidation challenges.
- `2-nested_tuple_set_questions.ipynb` – nested collections, tuples, and sets with visualization aids and performance notes.
- `3-control_flow_questions.ipynb` – control-flow scenarios, debugging tips, and recap summaries.
- `3-list_comprehension_questions-2.ipynb` – progressive list comprehension drills contrasted with equivalent loop-based solutions.
- `Practice/` – applied exercises that expand on core topics (functions, lambdas, map/filter, etc.).
- `SOLUTIONS_OVERVIEW.md` – entry point that maps questions to their solutions and highlights additional learning resources.
- `IMPROVEMENT_TASKS.md` – detailed checklist of all enhancement tasks (all core tasks completed ✅).
- `COMPLETION_REPORT.md` – comprehensive report documenting completed improvements and quality metrics.

## Getting started

1. **Environment** – Install Python 3.9+ with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. **Dependencies** – Most notebooks rely on the standard library. Install optional packages listed within individual notebooks if you plan to run extended examples.
3. **Usage** – Launch Jupyter in the repository root, open a notebook, and run the cells in order. Many notebooks include self-check prompts and smoke tests to validate your understanding.

## Current Status

All core improvement tasks have been completed (as of October 2025). See `COMPLETION_REPORT.md` for detailed metrics and achievements.

## Contribution guidelines

1. Review `IMPROVEMENT_TASKS.md` for stylistic conventions and any future enhancement ideas.
2. Apply consistent markdown formatting and ensure all code cells are executable.
3. When extending exercises, update `SOLUTIONS_OVERVIEW.md` so learners can discover the new material quickly.
4. Run available smoke tests in the notebooks or add new automated checks where practical.
